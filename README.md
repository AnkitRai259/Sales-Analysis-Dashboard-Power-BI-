# Sales Data Analysis Dashboard

# Overview
This repository contains a Sales Data Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into sales performance, and product trends, enabling businesses to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes comprehensive sales data, covering various aspects such as:
* OrderID
* ProductsName
* Region
* Quantity

# Data Tranformation and Cleaning
Before creating the dashboard, the dataset was transformed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and usability. The following steps were performed:

1. Data Import: Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Missing Values: Identified and handled missing values.
3. Data Types: Converted data types for consistency (e.g., dates, categories).
4. Outliers: Analyzed and addressed outliers that could skew analysis.
5. Aggregation: Aggregated data to derive meaningful insights (e.g., total sales by region).
6. Export: Saved the cleaned dataset for use in Power BI.
